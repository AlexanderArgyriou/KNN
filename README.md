# KNN

<h2>AI/ML/C++ Implementation of k-nearest neighbors supervised learning algorithm</h2>

* We Populate and classify the 4 quadrants of cartesian axis system with ("Rectangles", "Circles", "Triangles" and "Squares").
* We have a simple constraint that every object can exist in a single Point.
* Our Algorithm knows every existence of an object.
* We feed the algorithm with some objects in specific points of the 4 quadrants.
* We let our algorithm find the 7 closest known objects to the uknown object, so he can tell us what kind of an object it is.
* The simple maths and explanation behind the kNN algorithm - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm.
* U will need a C++14 or 17 or 20 compiler.
